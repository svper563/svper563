Hey there, I am svper563.  I usually go by super563, but that was taken. :(

I am here to start building a portfolio as I continue my education in computer programming.  

I am currently learning the ropes with Python, and I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge and skills.

I am excited to see where a career in programming can take me.
