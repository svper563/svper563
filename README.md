Hey there, I am svper563.  I usually go by super563, but that was taken. :(

I am here to start building a portfolio as I continue my education in computer programming.  

I see myself as a full-stack developer that makes web and mobile apps for small businesses, and I'm making strides to learn what I need to know.  

I am excited to see where a career in programming can take me.
